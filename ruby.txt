# Arrays:

		********Combining Arrays********

You can add two arrays together:;	

	a = [1, 2, 3]
	b = [4, 5]

	res = a + b
	print res # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

You can also subtract arrays, which will result in the first array removing any elements that also appear in second array.

	a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
	b = [2, 4, 5, 6]

	res = a - b
	print res #[1, 3]

		********Boolean Operations********

The & operator returns a new array containing the elements common to the two arrays, with no duplicates.

	a = [2, 3, 7, 8]
	b = [2, 7, 9]

	print a & b # [2, 7]

The | operator returns a new array by joining the arrays and removing duplicates.

	a = [2, 3, 7, 8]
	b = [2, 7, 9]

	print a | b # [2, 3, 7, 8, 9]

		********Moving Elements********

The reverse method returns a new array containing the original array elements in reverse order.

	arr = [5, 3, 8]
	res = arr.reverse
	print res # [8, 3, 5]


You can also reverse the array in place using the reverse! method:

	arr = [1, 2, 3]
	print arr.reverse!



		********Array Methods********

There are a number of other useful methods available for manipulating arrays.
Here are some of the most used ones:

	array.length or array.size returns the number of elements in array.
	array.sort returns a new array with the elements sorted
	array.uniq returns a new array with duplicate values removed from array.
	array.uniq! removes duplicates in place.
	array.freeze safeguards the array, preventing it from being modified.
	array.include?(obj) returns true if obj is present in array, false otherwise.
	array.min returns the element with the minimum value.
	array.max returns the element with the maximum value.
